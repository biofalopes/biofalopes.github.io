      <description>So I needed to learn how to scrape a web page using Python.
 My teammate suggested that I could learn a few tricks in python by scraping FIIs, which is the brazilian equivalent to american REITs. I did some research and found some good examples using a module called pandas (https://realpython.com/python-csv/) , a tool designed for data analisys and manipulation and very popular among people working with data science. My goal was much less ambitious but i thought i might as well use what everyone else is using, since it would provide a good learning opportunity.</description>

      <title>Comparsion of Sorting Algorithms using Python Decorators</title>

      <description>So I needed to learn how to use decorators in Python.
 I tried to come up with something within my current knowledge and since I was studying sorting algorithms, I decided to use decorators to measure how long each algorithm would take to complete and compare them. I know that it is kind of obvious which one is better in the proposed scenario for anyone with a Bachelor in Computer Science or any experienced developer, but the purpose here was to learn and develop my python skills.</description>

      <title>Ceph features and its relation to the client kernel version</title>

      <description>While working on an upgrade on one of our ceph cluster from Luminous to Nautilus, i needed to come up with a way to detect any client with older versions, and check if we could break anything after the upgrade.
 I started checking the documentation as always, but all i found was a command called ceph features, which gives a summarized output:
[root@mon-1 ~]# ceph features { &amp;quot;mon&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;release&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;luminous&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;num&amp;quot;: 3 } }, &amp;quot;mds&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;release&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;luminous&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;num&amp;quot;: 3 } }, &amp;quot;osd&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;release&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;luminous&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;num&amp;quot;: 192 } }, &amp;quot;client&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0x27018fb86aa42ada&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;release&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;jewel&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;num&amp;quot;: 422 }, &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0x2f018fb86aa42ada&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;release&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;luminous&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;num&amp;quot;: 95 }, &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;: { &amp;quot;features&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;release&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;luminous&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;num&amp;quot;: 18 } } } So that got me worried, since I was now looking at 422 clients apparently using jewel and we were already using Nautilus for a while.</description>

      <title>Obtaining a list of Ceph features from the hexadecimal value</title>

      <description>After some digging i found the list of possible features, its respective kernel version requirement and/or when it became available.
 This can be found in src/include/ceph_features.h, and I got it by cloning the ceph repo at git://github.com/ceph/ceph .
That information might be useful when you are trying to determine if your clients might need a kernel upgrade and what kind of RBD or cephfs features you can enable on your server side without breaking compatibility.</description>
