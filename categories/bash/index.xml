      <description>I needed to increase the pg_num of our biggest pool in Ceph, used for object storage, and we needed to gradually increase in small steps to avoid putting too much stress on the cluster.
 Our pool had 4096 PGs and we wanted to increase it to 8192. We don&amp;rsquo;t have pg autoscaler enabled, but even if we had it would set the value straight to 8192, which is not desired and also not recommended by Red Hat.</description>
