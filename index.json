    "body": "While working on an upgrade on one of our ceph cluster from Luminous to Nautilus, i needed to come up with a way to detect any client with older versions, and check if we could break anything after the upgrade. I started checking the documentation as always, but all i found was a command called ceph features, which gives a summarized output:\n[root@mon-1 ~]# ceph features { \u0026quot;mon\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 3 } }, \u0026quot;mds\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 3 } }, \u0026quot;osd\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 192 } }, \u0026quot;client\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x27018fb86aa42ada\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;jewel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 422 }, \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x2f018fb86aa42ada\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 95 }, \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 18 } } } So that got me worried, since i was now looking at 422 clients apparently using jewel and we were already using Nautilus for a while. Since this specific cluster was \u0026ldquo;born\u0026rdquo; in jewel, i thought that it might be the case that many clients didn\u0026rsquo;t get any upgrades since.\nAnother way to see who\u0026rsquo;s connected to the cluster is the command ceph tell mds.\\hostname` client ls`, but it shows only cephfs clients, which solves only a part of the problem. At least we can see the client\u0026rsquo;s IP address (adresses and names omitted with [\u0026hellip;]):\n\u0026quot;inst\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;client.1400410 v1:[...]]:0/1769731892\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;completed_requests\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;prealloc_inos\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;used_inos\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;client_metadata\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x00000000000001ff\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;entity_id\u0026quot;: [...], \u0026quot;hostname\u0026quot;: [...], \u0026quot;kernel_version\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;4.19.[...]\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;root\u0026quot;: [...] } Short note: there\u0026rsquo;s no documentation explaining those codes and its respective features, so i\u0026rsquo;m gonna look at the source code and try to come up with a table. I\u0026rsquo;ll post it as soon as i manage to.\nSearching further i came across the command ceph daemon mon.hostname sessions:\n[root@mon-1 ~]# ceph daemon mon.`hostname` sessions | grep jewel \u0026quot;MonSession(client.354037 v1:[...]]:0/3173650400 is open allow profile rbd, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.394132 v1:[...]:0/295867623 is open allow profile rbd, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.785407 v1:[...]:0/507474248 is open allow profile rbd, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.367883 v1:[...]:0/3274665177 is open allow profile rbd, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.812187 v1:[...]:0/733157529 is open allow profile rbd, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.1390811 v1:[...]:0/1470215921 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.1400452 v1:[...]:0/3851374868 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, Now i started to see some light at the end, since that command gave me the ip address and the version for each client connected. I knew that we don\u0026rsquo;t have any clients using ceph-fuse, so it was safe to assume that everyone was using the kernel module to mount either RBD or cephfs. That cleared some confusion i had at the beggining between the ceph-common package version and the kernel version. It is not required to have that package installed in order to use the kernel module, so i then pointed my efforts at checking the clients\u0026rsquo; kernel versions.\nThe documentation also recommended some debugging at mon:\n The ceph features command that reports the total number of clients and daemons and their features and releases. If the debugging level for Monitors is set to 10 (debug mon = 10), addresses and features of connecting and disconnecting clients are logged to log file on a local file system.\n So i tried that and here\u0026rsquo;s what we get with debug mon = 10:\n2020-11-10 08:55:59.084 7f31c9015700 0 --1- [v2:[...]:3300/0,v1:[...]:6789/0] \u0026gt;\u0026gt; conn(0x561a94aed180 0x561a94ba5000 :6789 s=ACCE PTING pgs=0 cs=0 l=0).handle_client_banner accept peer addr is really - (socket is v1:10.79.34.6:40764/0) 2020-11-10 08:55:59.085 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader) e1 ms_handle_accept con 0x561a94aed180 no session 2020-11-10 08:55:59.085 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader) e1 _ms_dispatch new session 0x561a94adcd80 MonSession(unknown.0 - is open , featu res 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel)) features 0x27018fb86aa42ada 2020-11-10 08:55:59.085 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader).auth v3676 preprocess_query auth(proto 0 34 bytes epoch 0) from unknown.0 - 2020-11-10 08:55:59.085 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader).auth v3676 prep_auth() blob_size=34 2020-11-10 08:55:59.085 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader).auth v3676 _assign_global_id 34110 (max 44096) 2020-11-10 08:55:59.085 7f31c500d700 2 mon.ceph-1@0(leader) e1 send_reply 0x561a958ba780 0x561a95246fc0 auth_reply(proto 2 0 (0) Success) v1 2020-11-10 08:55:59.086 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader).auth v3676 preprocess_query auth(proto 2 32 bytes epoch 0) from unknown.0 - 2020-11-10 08:55:59.086 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader).auth v3676 prep_auth() blob_size=32 2020-11-10 08:55:59.086 7f31c500d700 10 mon.ceph-1@0(leader) e1 ms_handle_authentication session 0x561a94adcd80 con 0x561a94aed180 addr - MonSession(unknown.0 - is open , features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel)) Without debug mon = 10, only the first line is logged.\nThat is very useful to detect the clients\u0026rsquo; features when they are connecting, but not so much when you can\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury to reset everyone\u0026rsquo;s connection. Besides, leaving that level of debugging enabled all the time would flag our node as an abuser at the log server in a matter of hours.\nWhat i knew already about our clients was that there was some elastic nodes using RBD, probably with CentOS 7 and consequently using kernel 3.x; Some other stuff also using RBD on either CentOS 7 or CentOS 8; and a kubernetes cluster using CoreOS and Flatcar with kernel 4.x. So after some checking, i compared the output from a client using kernel 4.19.x and another with 5.4.x:\n4.19.x:\n[root@spessrvbpcm00003 ~]# ceph daemon mon.`hostname` sessions | grep [...] \u0026quot;MonSession(client.95408384 [...]:0/923650579 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.95446387 [...]:0/421761626 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.95427342 [...]:0/1106672011 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/2823489235 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/4141488860 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/662892667 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/940509445 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/1147570690 is open allow r, features 0x27018fb86aa42ada (jewel))\u0026quot;, 5.4.x:\nroot@spessrvbpcm00003 ~]# ceph daemon mon.`hostname` sessions | grep [...] \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/2258512824 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/4186418195 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/232634731 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.95587947 [...]:0/3963151684 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/1164059037 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/1228306108 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/2811111809 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/4254695077 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(client.95587926 [...]:0/479729343 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/340770437 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MonSession(unknown.0 [...]:0/425381347 is open allow r, features 0x2f018fb86aa42ada (luminous))\u0026quot;, After that i could come with some conclusion. We are probably keep seeing jewel features for a long time, since CentOS/RHEL 8 and most of the main distros uses kernel 4.x on their latest LTS versions. I expected that at kernel 3.x i\u0026rsquo;d get Jewel features and from 4.x on we would get Luminous, but apparently the latest features are only available on kernels 5.x and beyond. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there is any feature that would be marked as nautilus or any newer ceph version, so i still need to dig deeper on that subject.\nReferences:\nhttps://ceph.io/community/new-luminous-upgrade-complete/\nhttps://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/operations/upmap/#enabling\nhttps://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/man/8/ceph/#osd\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/3.0/html/release_notes/major_updates\n",
