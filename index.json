    "description": "How the kernel version used on rbd/cephfs clients reflects on ceph features from the cluster perspective",
    "body": "While working on an upgrade on one of our ceph cluster from Luminous to Nautilus, i needed to come up with a way to detect any client with older versions, and check if we could break anything after the upgrade. I started checking the documentation as always, but all i found was a command called ceph features, which gives a summarized output:\n[root@mon-1 ~]# ceph features { \u0026quot;mon\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 3 } }, \u0026quot;mds\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 3 } }, \u0026quot;osd\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 192 } }, \u0026quot;client\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x27018fb86aa42ada\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;jewel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 422 }, \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x2f018fb86aa42ada\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 95 }, \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;features\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0x3ffddff8eeacfffb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;release\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;luminous\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;num\u0026quot;: 18 } } } So that got me worried, since i was now looking at 422 clients apparently using jewel and we were already using Nautilus for a while. Since this specific cluster was \u0026ldquo;born\u0026rdquo; in jewel, i thought that it might be the case that many clients didn\u0026rsquo;t get any upgrades since.\nContinues\u0026hellip;\n",
