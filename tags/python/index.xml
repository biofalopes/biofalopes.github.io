      <description>So i needed to learn how to use decorators in Python, and i tried to come up with something within my current knowledge and since i was studying sorting algorithms, i decided to use decorators to measure how long each algorithm would take to complete and compare them. I know that it is kind of obvious which one is better in the proposed scenario for anyone with a Bachelor in Computer Science or any experienced developer, but the purpose here was to learn and develop my python skills.</description>
