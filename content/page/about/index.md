I am a certified Cloud Architect and DevOps specialist with expertise in Kubernetes (CKA), Ceph, Terraform, AWS, and Azure. With 20 years of experience, I excel in building scalable, secure, and automated cloud infrastructure for global enterprises.

I hold professional AWS certifications, two expert Azure certifications (DevOps and Solutions Architect), and the HashiCorp Terraform Associate credential. I am also a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), showcasing my deep knowledge of container orchestration.

Fluent in English with a maximum TOEIC score, I am well-prepared to collaborate across international teams. I am actively seeking opportunities with US-based companies where I can leverage my expertise to deliver transformative cloud solutions.
