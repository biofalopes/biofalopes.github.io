As a seasoned cloud architect and DevOps expert, I specialize in designing and implementing scalable, secure, and efficient infrastructure solutions. With a deep foundation in Kubernetes, Ceph, Linux, and Terraform, and professional certifications in AWS, Azure, and GCP, I thrive in building cloud-native architectures that power modern applications.

I recently achieved the Google Professional Cloud Architect (PCA) certification and am actively pursuing advanced certifications in data engineering and AI to expand my expertise in creating data-driven solutions. My goal is to bridge the gap between infrastructure engineering and advanced analytics, delivering robust pipelines and intelligent systems that drive impactful decisions.

Key highlights:

Cloud Expertise: Hands-on experience with AWS, Azure, and GCP, including designing high-availability architectures and optimizing multi-cloud strategies.
DevOps Proficiency: Skilled in automation, CI/CD, and infrastructure as code, leveraging tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, and Jenkins to streamline deployments.
Data Engineering Focus: Currently enhancing my knowledge in building ETL pipelines, big data processing with Apache Spark, and cloud-based data warehousing solutions.
AI Aspirations: Exploring the intersection of AI and cloud engineering, with experience in data preprocessing and foundational machine learning concepts.
Fluent in English and experienced in collaborating with global teams, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems. I am actively seeking opportunities with US-based companies where I can contribute to innovative cloud and data solutions while continuously advancing my expertise in emerging technologies.
