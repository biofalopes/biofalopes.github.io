### **Step 3: Establishing Cross-Cloud Networking**

Connecting workloads across AWS and Azure was a critical step to enable seamless communication between the two Kubernetes clusters. This involved setting up secure, low-latency networking to handle inter-cloud traffic. Here’s how I achieved this step-by-step:

---

#### **1. Networking Design**
To ensure resilience and security, I designed the cross-cloud network to meet the following requirements:
- **Encrypted Communication**: Data in transit between clouds must be encrypted.
- **Reliable Connectivity**: Use redundant tunnels to avoid single points of failure.
- **Minimal Latency**: Optimize traffic routing for performance-critical workloads.

The solution involved:
- AWS Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) and Azure Virtual Network Gateway (VNet Gateway).
- IPsec VPN tunnels to establish encrypted connections between the VPC on AWS and the VNet on Azure.
- Route tables configured to enable communication between the two networks.

---

#### **2. AWS Configuration**
I began by creating the networking components in AWS.

**Create a Virtual Private Gateway (VPG):**
```hcl
resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "main" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
}
```

**Attach the VPG to the VPC:**
```hcl
resource "aws_vpn_gateway_attachment" "main" {
  vpc_id        = aws_vpc.main.id
  vpn_gateway_id = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
}
```

**Create a Customer Gateway for Azure:**
The Customer Gateway represents Azure's Virtual Network Gateway in AWS.
```hcl
resource "aws_customer_gateway" "azure" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "Azure-Gateway-Public-IP"
  type       = "ipsec.1"
}
```

**Establish a VPN Connection:**
```hcl
resource "aws_vpn_connection" "main" {
  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.azure.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"

  static_routes_only = true
}
```

---

#### **3. Azure Configuration**
On the Azure side, I set up the Virtual Network Gateway and connections.

**Create a Virtual Network Gateway:**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network_gateway" "main" {
  name                = "aws-azure-vnet-gateway"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name

  type     = "Vpn"
  vpn_type = "RouteBased"

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "vnetGatewayConfig"
    public_ip_address_id          = azurerm_public_ip.main.id
    private_ip_allocation_method  = "Dynamic"
    subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.gateway_subnet.id
  }
}
```

**Configure the Connection to AWS:**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network_gateway_connection" "aws" {
  name                           = "aws-connection"
  location                       = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  resource_group_name            = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  virtual_network_gateway_id     = azurerm_virtual_network_gateway.main.id
  type                           = "IPsec"
  shared_key                     = "PreSharedKeyForConnection" # Replace with a secure key
  remote_vpn_site_public_address = "AWS-VPG-Public-IP"
}
```

---

#### **4. Routing Configuration**
After establishing the connection, I configured routing to allow traffic between the two networks.

**AWS Route Table Updates:**
```hcl
resource "aws_route" "to_azure" {
  route_table_id         = aws_vpc.main.route_table_id
  destination_cidr_block = "Azure-VNet-CIDR" # Replace with Azure CIDR block
  gateway_id             = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
}
```

**Azure Route Table Updates:**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_route" "to_aws" {
  name                 = "route-to-aws"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  route_table_name     = azurerm_route_table.main.name
  address_prefix       = "AWS-VPC-CIDR" # Replace with AWS CIDR block
  next_hop_type        = "VirtualNetworkGateway"
}
```

---

#### **5. Testing the Connection**
After configuring the VPN, I tested connectivity between the two clouds to verify that the setup worked as expected.

1. **Ping Test:**
   I deployed a test pod in each Kubernetes cluster to validate connectivity.
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it test-pod -- ping Azure-Service-IP
   kubectl exec -it test-pod -- ping AWS-Service-IP
   ```

2. **Traffic Validation:**
   I used tools like `iperf` to measure latency and bandwidth between clusters:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it test-pod -- iperf -c <destination-IP>
   ```

3. **CloudWatch and Azure Monitor:**
   I monitored VPN traffic in AWS CloudWatch and Azure Monitor to confirm the tunnels were functioning as expected.

---

#### **6. High Availability**
To ensure resilience, I configured multiple tunnels between AWS and Azure. This involved:
- Configuring redundant IPsec VPN tunnels.
- Testing failover scenarios by simulating the loss of one tunnel and verifying traffic rerouted automatically.

**AWS Redundant Tunnel Configuration:**
```hcl
resource "aws_vpn_connection" "redundant" {
  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.azure.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"

  static_routes_only = true
}
```

**Azure Redundant Gateway Configuration:**
Repeat the configuration steps for Azure with an additional connection, ensuring failover paths exist.

---

### **Final Result**
With this setup, I achieved:
- Secure and encrypted communication between AWS and Azure.
- Low-latency traffic routing for application workloads.
- High availability with redundant tunnels.

This networking foundation ensured that my multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters could operate as a unified system, setting the stage for resilient and efficient workload deployments.
