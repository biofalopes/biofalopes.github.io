I recently passed the Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect (PCA) exam. With multiple cloud certifications under my belt, I have decided to shift my career towards data engineering and machine learning. This transition aligns with my growing interest in moving away from infrastructure and focusing more on Data and AI. Most of the time, I worked on provisioning, architecting, and maintaining solutions for other teams. Now, I want to be on the other side a bit more. As part of this journey, I'm pursuing the Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer (PDE) certification, and in this article, I’ll share my preparation journey, useful resources, and key takeaways to help you navigate your own study path. All referenced links are listed at the end of the post.

> ### TL;DR
> - Followed **Google Cloud Skills Boost** Data Engineer Path
> - Focused on **BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Pub/Sub**
> - Practiced with **ExamPrepper** mock tests
> - Did some Practice Exams I found on **Udemy**

### 1. Google Cloud Skills Boost

I started with **Google Cloud Skills Boost**, specifically the **Data Engineer Learning Path**, which consists of various hands-on labs. I focused on:

- **BigQuery**: Optimizing queries, partitioning, and clustering.
- **Dataflow**: Streaming and batch processing.
- **Dataproc**: Running Hadoop/Spark jobs on GCP.
- **Pub/Sub**: Event-driven architectures and message queues.
- **ML/AI**: Using Vertex AI, AI Platform, and AutoML.

While Skills Boost provided a solid foundation, in my opinion it lacks in-depth content. The videos are too short, so if you want to follow that format I recommend finding a good course at Udemy or Coursera. I tried to make the best of the labs, tinkering outside the tasks to leverage the free credits. Each module has a Quiz at the end, which also serves as a practice test.

### 2. Practice Tests

- **ExamPrepper**: There are currently 319 questions available for free and with comments from members. Extremely useful.
- **Google’s Official Sample Questions**: 21 questions, straight from the source. Not enough to prepare, but good to get a feel for the exam.

### 3. Key Skills for a Google Professional Data Engineer

- **Designing Data Processing Systems**: Architecting batch and streaming data processing solutions using GCP tools such as Dataflow, Dataproc, and Pub/Sub.
- **Operationalizing Machine Learning Models**: Deploying and managing ML models using Vertex AI, AI Platform, and AutoML.
- **Building and Maintaining Data Pipelines**: Implementing reliable and efficient ETL workflows with Cloud Composer and Dataflow.
- **Ensuring Solution Quality**: Applying best practices for data governance, security, and compliance using IAM, Data Catalog, and encryption techniques.
- **Optimizing Data Solutions**: Performance tuning and cost optimization for BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and other GCP data services.
- **Monitoring and Troubleshooting Data Pipelines**: Implementing observability with Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, and error handling strategies.

### 6. Summary

My preparation involved structured learning through Google Cloud Skills Boost, deep dive with labs and extensive practice exams. Understanding data storage, processing, security, architecture and use cases is critical. If you plan to take the PDE exam, ensure hands-on experience with BigQuery, Dataflow, and Dataproc, and be ready to evaluate real-world scenarios involving data engineering.
